# Oh Democracy Together

Your eyes are on the voices of the humans we will be  
if we walk with our democracy for all whom we can see.  
We are making a new story by our ears integrity  
of how we may be free.  

Oh Democracy together!  
Oh Democracy together!  
Oh Democracy together!  
Of how we may be free!  

In the camps and in the doorways they sing holy and profane  
as you hold their hands and listen to the rapture of their brain!  
Midst the ruins all around us inspiration crosses pain  
for strength to break our chain!  

Oh Democracy together!  
Oh Democracy together!  
Oh Democracy together!  
for strength to break our chain!  

There is hope for all the children forced to live in a disguise  
that has slandered our kind decency and steals at night our eyes.  
Though many hearts are broken hard, we still can recognize  
the light with which we rise!  

Oh Democracy together!  
Oh Democracy together!  
Oh Democracy together:  
the light with which we rise!  

You are knocking back the feudal lords who grasp what they can steal!  
We are raising the softspoken to proclaim the way they feel!  
You are chanting every story's understanding as we kneel  
and now begin to heal!  

Oh Democracy together!  
Oh Democracy together!  
Oh Democracy together!  
We now begin to heal!  

You are here and all around us giving patient love to thought!  
You are asking all the questions that we never would have brought!  
Oh fly up my heart to wrestle the grim angel we have wrought  
for our good word is sought!  

Oh Democracy together!  
Oh Democracy together!  
Oh Democracy together,  
for our good word is sought!
